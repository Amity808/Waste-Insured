# Waste-Management-Chain
**A waste management supply chain blockchain solution**

In this project we aim to solve the problem of waste management by providing a reward based system for Individuals who 
participate.

- Waste are collected and submitted to a waste bank.
- The rewards are calculated based on the weight of the waste submitted.
- The participants are rewarded when they reach pre-set milestone.
- The wastes accepted by the waste bank are categorized into Plastics and Metals.
- This project also includes a voting system where participants can vote on executing initiatives relating to the waste bank.
